# Online REPLs

The term REPL means **R**ead-**E**valuate-**P**rint-Loop. Such tools work like this:

1. Enter a command or expression
2. The input is processed
3. The result is output

Shells are REPLs. The (full screen) editors of home computers are, too. But you can also use them to learn a program language.
