# String interpolation

[Back](README.md) to main page

Kotlin and Dart do string interpolation by prefixing variable names with `$`. JavaScript uses `` `...${}...` ``. C# wants `$"...{}..."`. Swift likes `"...\()..."`. Sadly, Java offers no string interpolation. Still, there certainly is powerful `String.format(...)`.
