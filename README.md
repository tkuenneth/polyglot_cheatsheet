## Welcome to the polyglot cheatsheet
This repo contains a cheatsheet for the polyglot developer.

### Conventions
If an element is put in square brackets `[like this]` it means that *like this* can be omitted (it is optional).

### Friendly
The cheat sheet does not want to judge. No language is considered better or superior.

### Contributions welcome
