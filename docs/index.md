The times when we could focus on one programming language are long gone. These days we are expected to be fluent in several ones. Even in one project we may face a backend written in Java, an Android app in Kotlin, an iOS app written in Swift, and maybe a Web client in JavaScript. Most programming language share a lot of common concepts, yet they differ regarding implementation. So, it's easy to get confused. 

But don't panic. 

This cheat sheet for the polyglot developer lists important concepts and shows how they are represented in **C#**, **Dart**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Kotlin** and **Swift**. 

The cheat sheet does not want to judge. No language is considered better or superior. So, the cheat sheet aims to be a humble tool to help you understand and appreciate similarities and differences. 

### Contributions

The polyglot cheat sheet is a collection of markdown files. You can find the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/tkuenneth/polyglot_cheatsheet). It is released under the terms of the [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/tkuenneth/polyglot_cheatsheet/blob/master/LICENSE). If you feel that something should be added, please do so. If you find out that something is wrong, please contribute, too. The [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) has a nice overview of the markdown syntax.

### How to use the cheat sheet

If you want to try something quickly, there is no need to install a complete IDE. You can find so-called *REPL*s on the web. The term means **R**ead-**E**valuate-**P**rint-Loop. Such tools work like this:

1. Enter a command or expression
2. The input is processed
3. The result is output

Shells are REPLs. The (full screen) editors of home computers were, too. But you can also use them to learn a program language.

|Language|REPL|
|-|-|
|Dart|[DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/)|
|JavaScript|[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)|
|Kotlin|[Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/)|
|Swift|[Online Swift Playground](http://online.swiftplayground.run/)|

If an element is put in square brackets `[like this]` it means that *like this* can be omitted (it is optional).
